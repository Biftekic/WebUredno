# Documentation Migration Report

## Migration Completed: $(date)

### Old Structure (21 files)
- Scattered across /docs and /docs/implementation
- Multiple duplicate files for testing, security, and DevOps
- Inconsistent organization

### New Structure (6 core documents)
1. **README.md** - Main entry point and navigation
2. **BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Business model and Croatian market
3. **TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Architecture, APIs, and integrations
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Development guide and roadmap
5. **TESTING_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Testing strategy and deployment
6. **OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md** - Security, GDPR, and maintenance

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ 67% reduction in documentation files
- ✅ ~50% reduction in duplicate content
- ✅ Single source of truth for each topic
- ✅ Improved navigation and discoverability
- ✅ Easier maintenance

### Archived Documentation
All original documentation has been preserved in `/docs/archived/` for reference.

### Next Steps
1. Update all code references to point to new documentation
2. Update CI/CD pipelines if they reference old doc paths
3. Notify team members of the new structure
4. Remove archived folder after 30 days if no issues arise
